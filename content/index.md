==========================

Hello there, my name is Arthur I am 21 years old. I enjoy playing games and problems solving. Because of this
programming seemed to be a good equilibrium for my interests. I also work at a company that develops software 
which is another reason I am taking this course, I enjoy the development of software and being part of the solution 
but webdesign has always been one of my favorite thhings to do when I have some time to spare. 

Some other things that you might be interested in. I speak two languages English and Swedish but I wish I could speak another.
You will have to guess which one :D. I love being outdoors and camping but its not often I get to do that. Im a big fan of dogs and cats
but I guess most people are so its not that special I just wanted to say it. My favorite foods (You cannot just have one favorite) are Sushi,
any cut of steak cooked to medium rare. Theres probably more but I think you get the gist.
